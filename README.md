# Bacterial Biodiversity Analysis
## HTML Javascript

For this project, I took information on bacteria biodiversity and created an app to visualize the data. Where was this bacteria found? Inside patients' belly buttons, of course!
The app was created with HTML and Javascript and uses a drop down menu to select a specific patient and view their bacteria cultures:

Choosing different patients creates new charts and diagrams to view the types of bacteria!
